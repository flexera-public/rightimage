This cookbook relies on fog and will install the version\nit needs.\n\n# ATTRIBUTES:\n\nNo attributes. Currently not usable as a standalone cookbook, meant to be called\nfrom other cookbooks only. Note that a trailing slash on remote_path makes a difference.\nIf there is a trailing slash, the filename will be appended to the remote path.\nIf there is not a trailing slash, the file will be renamed.\n\n# USAGE:\n  \n    include_recipe \"ros_upload\" # installs fog\n\n    ros_upload \"/path/to/file\" do\n      provider  \"ros_upload_s3\"\n      user      node[:cookbook][:aws_access_key_id]\n      password  node[:cookbook][:aws_secret_access_key]\n      container node[:cookbook][:s3_bucket]\n      remote_path \"subdir/\"\n      action :upload\n    end\n",
